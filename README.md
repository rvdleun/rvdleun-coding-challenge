# Introduction

This project was created to demonstrate how I would setup a simple sign-up form. The form itself has the following requirements...

* The form should allow users to enter first name, last name, email, and password.
* All fields are required.
* Password validation:
  * Should be a minimum of eight characters,
  * Should contain lower and uppercase letters,
  * Should not contain userâ€™s first or last name.
* Email should be validated but there are various ways of accomplishing this. So, show us what you consider as a proper email validation.

# Used frameworks and tools
* [Angular](http://angular.io/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)
